Scratchpad for VHDL experiments.

To build these projects you will need Xilinx ISE WebPack, which you can get from here:

    http://www.xilinx.com/support/download

Load the project into the ISE GUI, then click "Implement Design" to build it. Once
you've built the project for the first time, you can then rebuild the project using
the Makefile. In addition to reimplementing the design from the VHDL and constraint
files, the Makefile will generate an XSVF programming file ready for upload to a
real device.
