Clone of Digilent's dpimref.vhd. Cleaned up design so no special FSM tuning is
necessary. Build it, load it into your Nexys2 board using Digilent Adept, then
go to "Register I/O". In the first column enter register addresses 0x00, 0x01,
0x02 and 0x03. Then in the next (non-grey) column enter some data, e.g 0x23,
0x42, 0xFE, 0xCA. Now click "Write All" and then "Read All". The values are all
read back.
