Clone of Digilent's dpimref.vhd. Cleaned up design so no special FSM tuning is
necessary. Build it, load it into your Nexys2 board using Digilent Adept, then
go to "Register I/O". In the first column enter register addresses 0x00, 0x01,
0x02 and 0x03. Then in the next (non-grey) column enter some data, e.g 0x23,
0x42, 0xFE, 0xCA. Now click "Write All". You can see that the value you wrote
to register 0x03 is now displayed on the LEDs. Now click "Read All". The values
are all read back, except register 0x03, which when read returns the state of
the switches.
