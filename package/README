Demonstrate the VHDL package abstraction.

Packages allow you to wrap up bits of related logic and type definitions so they can be easily
re-used. My motivation for doing this was that I wanted a way to test a block of logic that has a
port of user-defined type (i.e an enumeration). A VHDL package seems to be the best way to wrap up a
logic block and its associated enumerated types.

Building a Digilent S3BOARD .bit file: cd package; make
(btn3 = op_in, btn2 = a_in, btn1 = b_in, led0 = x_out)

Simulating: cd gate; make; make waves
